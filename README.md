# Calorie Tracker (in progress)

The goal is to eventually combine this frontend app with the "fit_app" backend. For the development stage, the backend is mocked with Miragejs.
## Description
- User can search for food in the database that will be pre-populated with the most common foods (source of the data can be the USDA’s database https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/). Such food doesn’t have an “owner” and is available to all users ("public" food). 
- User can also add their own food. Such food belongs to the user and is not visible to anyone else ("private" food).
- User can track their food consumption for both categories of food ("public" and "private").
- User can set their daily calorie budget
- User can see their average calorie consumption for the last week/month

## Technologies
React 18.3 and React Router 6.26, HTML, CSS
